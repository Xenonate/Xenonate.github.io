      Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

      Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.

        My take on the Dev Bootcamp experiance is to approach DBC as a 'Cook' not a 'consumer' meaning that its a group thing, we are all attending the course for a reason, to learn. we have to work togeather to learn and become better togeather.

        My view on DBC is that everyone is passionate about programing, and i think that this is an amazing enviroment to be learning in, as i also feel passionate about programming. I am excited to learn in the enviroment that everyone in the cohort as well as my teachers are just as excited about learning how to program as what i am. 

        I guess it makes me nervous that i am not good enough for DBC, not just for me but for everyone in my cohort, i dont want to be the person that lets everybody in the class down and i hope that my skills and knowledge assist the rest of my cohort somehow. 

        - woops i forgot to push!
