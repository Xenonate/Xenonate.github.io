    <h1>My Thinking Style</h1>
    
<p>I have a Concrete Random thinking style and after researching this a little, i couldnâ€™t agree more. i think that this learning style does actually suit me most out of all of them. I am the type of person that likes to go into a project and play around and experiment  in order to find the correct answer. i think that this can be both a benefit and disadvantage however.</p>

<p>The benefits that i can see from having this type of learning style is that i am not scared to try out new things, diving into the deep end so to speak. Things like competing with others and working on major issues by myself are things that i now realise i do. Saying this though, when i did my test my scores were also very high in Abstract Sequential (32) and Abstract Random(36), and some of the qualities of those thinking styles i see in myself as well, where my Concrete Sequential score was really low (8), which i can also see within myself.</p>

<p>However, the downside of my main thinking style is that i hate routines and structures as well as. Apparently as well, i hate explaining how i came up with answers, which would make sense if the way i stumble upon my answers is by trial and error. I think that an important thing for me to do in the future is to document my workings as i go along (psudocoding!)</p>

<p>I think that i do have quite a growth mindset, from my personal thinking quiz, my AS AR and CR are all quite high and even, however my CS is almost non existent which. i think and know that for me personally that training my brain to have more even mindset will set me up for great things in the future, however there will be habits that i would need to change in order for this to be achiveable.</p>
