      Describe version control

      Verson control records changes to a file or set of files which allows you to recall specific versions on a later date. There are 2 main types of version control that you can use, Local Version Control and Distributed Version Control.

      Local version control is a type of version control that people use for thier own files or set of files. the file/s that are saved are saved onto thier own computer allowing them to recall earlier versions of their own files. 

      Distributed Version control however uses local version control as well. Once you are happy with the work that you have done and commit your changes. you can then push your files to a Distributed version contol system (such as github). This acts as your main or master version database where muliple users can push and pull to.

      Explain how git tracks changes

      The way that git tracks changes is quite a simple process, technically speaking it simply spots the difference between the head tree and the index (or main working document) once changes have been found any items that are only found in the index are will be asked for the changes to be added in git and all items that only appear in the HEAD will be removed.

      The HEAD is known as the latest comit that is recorded on git. the latest version.

      The index is the current file that is being worked on.

      Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code

      There are many reasons why GitHub is a great way to store code.
      GitHub allows multiple users to work on the same project at the same time. without the fear of losing or somebody replacing over work.
      It also allows users to download the repository and work on the repository within thier own local git and make changes in there before pushing them to GitHub - this supplies added security to the master file located on GitHub becuase only the complete files are added. Meaning there is a less likelyhood of incomplete files being added to the master database.
      GitHub is also open-source, it allows you to share your information to other members of the public.
